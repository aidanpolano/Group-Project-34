    "<h2>Introduction</h2> Researchers at UBC led by Frank Wood collected data about how people play video games by setting up MineCraft servers and recording various types of data. One of their goals was to determine which player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?
